# FluidImage
React based component for efficiently and effectively displaying images


## Roadmap

#### In no particular order

- Logic for plugable `<Image>`, `<ThumbnailImage>` and `<Placeholder>` components
- Replace usage of crop for dimensions with height / width ratios. Crop is provider specific
- Providers interface for popular image services e.g. [imgix](https://docs.imgix.com/apis/url)
- Remove duplicated props usage in tests
- NPM publishing scripts
- Better Default Props using Typescript? [Read here](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/ultimate-react-component-patterns-with-typescript-2-8-82990c516935)
- webpack config?
- Automatic Bundle size reporting and monitoring
- Automatic code quality automation [Codacy](http://codacy.com/)
- Automatic performance reporting and monitoring e.g 10/100/1000 elements
- Storybook static deploy
- Automated testing Coverage reporting and display
